# Accenture's AI challenge
## Object detector of the Accenture logo implemented on Android
- The code below implements an object detector for the Accenture logo on Android;
- The object detector was built using the YOLO v3 tiny model;
- YOLO stands for "you look only once";
- The YOLO v3 tiny is a simplified, shallower version of the YOLO v3 model;
- YOLO v3 tiny has lower accuracy relative to YOLO v3, but it is faster than its counter part, which makes it more appropriate for mobile applications;
- The Accenture logo object detector was built on top of pretrained weights (transfer learning);
- Both the yolov3 model and the pretrained weights were implemented using the darknet neural network framework;
## Outcome
Android app that takes pictures and performs detection of the Accenture's logo
